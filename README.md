# Repository Template

Well-manageable and well-maintainable repository template.

## The Purpose

The purpose is to have a template repository and to have it *well-manageable* and *well-maintainable* by both human beings and automation tools.

The rationale behind this is that taking care of tens or hundreds of repositories while keeping them working, tidy, consistent, and up-to-date, might be a daunting task.

The way how to achieve the desired state of manageability and maintainability is to *unify* and *automate* workflow to allow frequent small changes for multiple projects at scale.

Objectives:

- Simple and easy environment check and setup
- Fast and unified code change contribution
- Automated and reliable code change propagation (build, testing, integration, publish, or deployment)

Strategies and tactics to achieve objectives:

1. Automate
2. Automate
3. Automate

## Features

- Automated workflow using [GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/continuous-integration/)
  - GitLab CI skips CI if commit contains `[skip ci]` in the commit message
- Each codebase change is scanned and rules are applied:
  - Enforces max file size using [pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks: check-added-large-files](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks#check-added-large-files)
  - Checks YAML using [pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks: check-yaml](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks#check-yaml)
  - Enforces files end with empty newline using [pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks: end-of-file-fixer](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks#end-of-file-fixer)
  - Prevents trailing whitespaces using [pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks: trailing-whitespace](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks#trailing-whitespace)
- When merged to `main` branch releases using [semantic-release/semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)
  - Determines major, minor, or patch version bump using [semantic-release/commit-analyzer](https://github.com/semantic-release/commit-analyzer)
  - Generates release notes using [semantic-release/release-notes-generator](https://github.com/semantic-release/release-notes-generator)
  - Generates changelog using [semantic-release/changelog](https://github.com/semantic-release/changelog)
  - Commits changelog and new version using [semantic-release/git](https://github.com/semantic-release/git)
  - Releases new version by tagging using [semantic-release/gitlab](https://github.com/semantic-release/gitlab)
  - Releases new version by tagging using [semantic-release/github](https://github.com/semantic-release/github)
  - Semantic-release skips release if commit contains `[skip release]` or `[release skip]` in the commit message
- Repository `tools/update-repo` script updates used dependencies

## Setup

### GitLab Releases

Set up [GitLab Personal Access Token](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens) with at least scopes `api` and `write_repository` as the group or the project variable:

- Settings
  - CI/CD
    - Variables, *Expand*
      - *Add Variable*:
        - Key: **GL_TOKEN**
        - Value: *token*
        - Flags:
          - Protect variable: **On**

### GitHub Releases

Set up [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/about-authentication-to-github#authenticating-with-the-api) with at least scopes `repo` for a private repository or `public_repo` for a public repository, as the group or the project variable:

- Settings
  - CI/CD
    - Variables, *Expand*
      - *Add Variable*:
        - Key: **GH_TOKEN**
        - Value: *token*
        - Flags:
          - Protect variable: **On**
