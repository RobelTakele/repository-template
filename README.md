# Repository Template

Well-manageable and well-maintainable repository template.

## The Purpose

The purpose is to have a template repository and to have it *well-manageable* and *well-maintainable* by both human beings and automation tools.

The rationale behind this is that taking care of tens or hundreds of repositories while keeping them working, tidy, consistent, and up-to-date, might be a daunting task.

The way how to achieve the desired state of manageability and maintainability is to *unify* and *automate* workflow to allow frequent small changes for multiple projects at scale.

Objectives:

- Simple and easy environment check and setup
- Fast and unified code change contribution
- Automated and reliable code change propagation (build, testing, integration, publish, or deployment)

Strategies and tactics to achieve objectives:

1. Automate
2. Automate
3. Automate
